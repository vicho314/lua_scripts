# lua_scripts
Some (useless) lua scripts, mainly shell utilities, small programs or libraries

* album : m3u automaker
  - makes a playlist by scanning current dir 
  - moves a playlist to MUSIC dir
  - shows all m3u albums in MUSIC
  - plays given album with PLAYER

* vigenere : poor man's text encryption by using Vigen√®re cipher. It just works (only with standard Latin chars!).

* dozen : some utilities to convert from decimal to dozenal units (0-9XE) (time, %, floats, etc)

See inside the files for more info (USAGE, etc). USE WITH CAUTION.
